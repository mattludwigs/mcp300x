# MCP300X

Library for working the MCP300X Analog-to-Digitial Converters.

## Road map

This library is under active development and supports single channel
reads using the MCP3008 ADC. So, here is the goals of this library:

- [ ] Support MCP3002
- [ ] Support MCP3004
- [ ] Support Differential Reads
- [ ] Support MSBF

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `mcp300x` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:mcp300x, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/mcp300x](https://hexdocs.pm/mcp300x).
